🎶 SQL + Python Integration: MusicDB Project  

📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to design a relational database in SQL and integrate it with Python for data ingestion, querying, and analysis.  
Using a music-themed dataset, I built a database schema (`MusicDB`) with multiple connected tables such as albums, artists, tracks, customers, invoices, and playlists.  

The project follows a structured workflow:  
Schema Design → ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) → Querying & Analysis

🔹 Features  
- 📂 Database Design: Normalized schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and many-to-many relationships.  
- 🔗 SQL + Python Connectivity: Using `mysql-connector` and `SQLAlchemy` for smooth integration.  
- ⚡ ETL Workflow: Load raw data files (CSV/Excel) into SQL tables with Python scripts.  
- 📊 Data Analysis: Perform joins, aggregations, and trend analysis (e.g., top customers, popular genres, playlist insights).  
- 🛠️ Scalable Workflow: Clear structure for extending to dashboards or ML pipelines.  

 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- SQL (MySQL) → Database schema, DDL & DML operations  
- Python → Data loading & querying  
- SQLAlchemy & mysql-connector → Database connection & ORM  
- pandas → Data ingestion and transformation  
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook → Development environment  

📊 Example Insights  
- Top 5 Genres by track count  
- Most valuable customers by invoice total  
- Playlist compositions and trends
